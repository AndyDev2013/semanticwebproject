# Project Outline

* Create a GitHub repo (this one) with Readme file using MarkDown format. 
* Find two open datasets,describe the datasets, their use and upload them to the repo for reference.
* Create a set of urls for querying these data sets, make sure to account for the type of actions that will be carried out on this dataset, enable http requests other then GET and document all of this.
* Decide on the best way to store the information (what kind of database)
* Describe each function of the api and the type of data returned.
* Comment on all of the code clearly

# Chosen Datasets

Choosing from both of these datasets 

* [DataGov Link](https://data.gov.ie/data)
* [CSO](http://www.cso.ie/)

After checking over them all I decided to use the following three datasets

* [Galway County Scenic Routes](https://data.gov.ie/dataset/galway-county-scenic-routesf5940)
* [Public Visitor Attractions Open Data](https://data.gov.ie/dataset/galway-city-public-visitor-attractions)
* [Galway City Parks](http://opendata.galwaycity.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/683ff500430447c985f4775a6b5dd112_0)

The goal of combining these three datasets is to point out if public visitor attractions and Galway parks are close to each other. This kind of information can be used for

* creating walking tours
* creating bus tours around galway
* guiding the flow of tourists through the cities

# Integration Plan

I plan on developing the api using Node.JS using the chosen data sets. To give the user a quick way of accessing all of the functions I'm adding to the API I wish to develop a webpage using a prebuilt bootstrap template but heavily editing it for my needs. Seeing the project will be using Node.js and be heavily reliant on Javascript I have chosen the D3 library for this.

Mention node.js modules...
Mention chosen database...
Mention which D3 graphs show best..

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [BootStrap Template](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/sb-admin/)
* [D3 Library](http://d3js.org/)
